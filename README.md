# JSON Parser
*By JJ Wanda*

## Goals
I want anyone to be able to use this library to get parse json data from a website. Only adding one extra method in extending it In order to do so.

## To Do
The existing code is currently from a private repo for an Android App. Right now this code needs an Android.jar to parse code.

* Delete the android.jar (change to java.net.* instead of org.apache.*)
* Create test functions
* Add Javadocs
* Add specific static methods if one does not want to extend the class but just use it.

As you can tell I am pretty new to this. Bare with me!
