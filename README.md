# JSON POST - PUT - GET
*By JJ Wanda*

The general idea of this is to be able to be able to put, post, delete, and get JSON data by either extending the class or using the provided static methods.

## Goals
I want anyone to be able to use this library to get parse json data from a website. Only adding one extra method in extending it In order to do so.

## To Do
The existing code is currently from a private repo for an Android App. Right now this code needs an Android.jar to parse code.

* Create test functions
* Add specific static methods if one does not want to extend the class but just use it.
* Add uses section
* Change repository to JSON POST - PUT - GET

As you can tell I am pretty new to this. Bare with me!
